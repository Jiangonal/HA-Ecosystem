No, first something is wrong with the entities IDs although I didn't directly see in the implementation why, maybe you should remove the device and add it again to generate new entity IDs. The cover on the 2nd example should be:
`light.switcher_run_plus_a9be_light`
`cover.switcher_run_plus_a9be_runner_1`
`cover.switcher_run_plus_a9be_runner_2`

I also suggest to change the name from ""Runner"" to ""Shutter"" or ""Cover"" as ""Runner"" is the device name by the manufacture and a ""Runner"" device may have both shutter control and light control.

Sure will do.
Rebase is harder because all the conflicts. I am trying to solve it..",2024-10-26T14:22:32Z,True,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127277,YogevBokobza,True,,
Issue,YogevBokobza,"@thecode 
So right now after rebase and fix we have those cases:
Normal Runner(Normal, Mini etc) - will look like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f245fe28-0fe4-488a-9825-4c12aac9b9cb)

IDs:
cover.balcony_runner
NOTE1: The name here comes from the Switcher App setup.
NOTE2: Leave it as it was before

Runner S11 - will look like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1edf2da5-4393-472b-995b-f96868785d5f)

IDs:
cover.switcher_runner_6cf5
light.switcher_runner_6cf5_light_1
light.switcher_runner_6cf5_light_2

Runner S12 - will look like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58f02527-59d1-402b-883a-4b7ccdd696ba)

IDs:
cover.switcher_run_plus_a9be_cover_1
cover.switcher_run_plus_a9be_cover_2
light.switcher_run_plus_a9be_light

I think that:
1. We should rename ""DualCover"" and ""DualLight"" to ""ComplexCover"" and ""ComplexLight"" so this will support the later 3 lights modules
2. I didn't like the S11 cover to get the actual device name (which is not what it is on the Switcher App), instead, I think that S11 should move to the ""ComplexCover"" and name it Cover

Regarding that, After some testing, I think that if we want to accomplish (1) and (2) we need to change to:
`class SwitcherDualCoverEntity` will be split into 2:  `class SwitcherComplexSingleCoverEntity` and `class SwitcherComplexMultiCoverEntity` (Same will go for light)

So creating the entities will look like this:
```
        if coordinator.data.device_type.category == DeviceCategory.SHUTTER:
            async_add_entities([SwitcherSingleCoverEntity(coordinator, 0)])
        if (
            coordinator.data.device_type.category
            == DeviceCategory.SINGLE_SHUTTER_DUAL_LIGHT
        ):
            async_add_entities([SwitcherComplexSingleCoverEntity(coordinator, 0)])
        if (
            coordinator.data.device_type.category
            == DeviceCategory.DUAL_SHUTTER_SINGLE_LIGHT
        ):
            async_add_entities([SwitcherComplexMultiCoverEntity(coordinator, 0)])
            async_add_entities([SwitcherComplexMultiCoverEntity(coordinator, 1)])
```
Also adding `single_cover` to strings..

Issue,frenck,"So, I've been looking at this from the sidelines and discussed this a bit with @MartinHjelmare (and in the past with @bramkragten as well), and I think this PR is close but should take a different approach.

## Taking a step back first

One of the biggest issues (IMHO) for end-users, in general, is: Getting the tokens!
There are many ways to get the tokens, but most are not straightforward and is often way to complicated for users.

There is now a program that uses the cloud to get the tokens, but it triggers some virus scanners on Windows and on Mac is refuses to run initially (because unsigned and untrusted).

## This PR

This PR actually brings in the cloud to fetch information, but only in a specific use case.

## Suggestion

So, as for my suggestion, based on the above 2 things; I would like to propose a solution that makes the integration easier to set up for users, uses the cloud when needed, but still allows to use without.

Config flow:

- Ask to add devices via the cloud OR manually via IP/Token (make sure to mark the cloud as easier / default/recommend for easy set up)
- Selected: Cloud
  - Ask for login
  - List devices so a user can choose the device to add (filtered by devices that are already added).
  - Create a local entry with a token from the cloud as usual. If an EU gateway is chosen, store cloud credentials additionally, so the functionality in this PR works as expected.
- Select: Manual
  - Follows the current config flow.
  - If an EU gateway is chosen, ask for cloud credentials, so the functionality in this PR works as expected.
  

Additionally: Using this process, if a config entry needs the  cloud (e.g., in case of the EU gateway), re-auth can be triggered as needed as well.

This would remove the need to stuff it into the options flow as well.

Result: Happy end-user. We made integrating Xiaomi devices more easy, still control them locally. No weirdness to get a token and the cases that do need the cloud, are handled just like any other integration.",2021-05-17T07:52:42Z,True,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/47955,starkillerOG,True,,
Issue,starkillerOG,"@frenck thank you for your input and clear story.
I have been thinking about this for a while too since the cloud would indeed allow much easier integration for users (instead of the tokens).

Through the cloud a list of all Miio devices can be retrieved with all there connection details (also local IP of the device).
Therefore we could make it such that a user needs to setup the integration only once with it's Cloud credentials and that all Miio devices are then added automatically. As opposed to setting up one integration per device (and having to supply the same cloud credentials each time.

The only problem I see with that aproach are the unique_ids, If you setup all devices using one cloud integration you only set one unique ID (based on the username of the cloud probably), A user could then also setup a device manually and the unique ID would then be set based on the individual device ending up with 2x the same device (one through the cloud and one configured manually). So bassically mixing manual and cloud setup would then be a problem.
Furthermore if the Miio device list is obtained from the Cloud, that would mean the integration will be reliant on a internet connection and the Miio cloud servers during integration init (each time the integration is started). If we make an integration per device we can store all relevant information locally and are only reliant on internet/cloud during config flow setup.

@frenck What do you think: 1 integration per device or one central integration with all devices using cloud.

It is not really about the country but the model of the gateway (I call it EU gateway because that model has an EU power plug and it ment to be sold in the EU but obviously you can also use it outside the EU countries or use a diffrent model gateway inside the EU, the diffrent models are listed here https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_miio/#supported-xiaomi-gateway-models).

At the moment other gateway models don't really benefit from using the cloud option, although I have seen some issues where localy retrieving the device list gives errors (related to max message size in miio local portecol) if large amounts of subdevices are connected (40+), users experiancing such problems cloud probably use the cloud option to get it working, but that has not been tested.
Besides for the future there are things that can be done with the cloud which is locally not possible (such as retrieving the last time (timestamp) a motion sensor has seen motion)

I was also wondering about that. Actually I was, at first, already under the impression variables such as `entity_id` would be available and then had to figure out the work around.

Then again, the MQTT component is probably a component that is used for customization more than most others. As such it might be a good place to start and work it out from there to other components.",2021-02-02T17:09:44Z,False,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/45751,qistoph,False,,

Not the same case.
There can be (and will be) a lot of devices with the `channel_names=CHANNEL_THERMOSTAT` that wouldn't have the ZONNSMART presets, at least all the not quirked devices.

@gmsoft-tuxicoman code points to `channel_names=""tuya_manufacturer""` devices. Not sure if only the quirked ones will match here and that is a question that I will ask to him.

> @javicalle Is it possible overriding the manufacture ""TS0601"" in the quirk to somthing like ""TS0601-TRVZS"" and using it in ZHA ? Then is only quirked devices that is using it.

I would prefer my other approach: to overwrite the `ep_attribute` for that devices like that:
```python
class SiterwellManufCluster(TuyaManufClusterAttributes):
    """"""Manufacturer Specific Cluster of some thermostatic valves.""""""

    ep_attribute = ""tuya_trv""

    attributes = TuyaManufClusterAttributes.attributes.copy()
    attributes.update(
        {
            .../...
    )
```

This way you can ensure that all the `channel_names=""tuya_trv""` are quirked and are of type TRV (`TS0601` is plenty of diferents device types).

But this approach has not been approved and not sure if is the way to go.

In any case, I'll be against any approach that involves keeping the list of `manufacturers` on both sides (ZHA and the quirks).",2023-02-06T21:03:05Z,True,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87546,gmsoft-tuxicoman,False,,

Most of tuya MCU devices is first coming one and later its coming more versions with the same functionality and its one PITA patching quirks and ZHA.
If getting one ""master"" quirk and one handle in ZHA for the device type /class and only need updating the quirk is being much better then today.

Right now it seems that the new components would benefit the other TRV as well but the window_detection component.
The window_detection attribute is an array for the Moes TRVand it would definitely break.

So I can update my zha-device-handler PR and add zonnsmart_trv as the ep_attribute as it seems like a sensible approach but other TRVs will not benefit from the new components.

There is also another approach. We could modify HA to be able to match the quirk_class. Maybe it would be best and solve the matching even for different devices.
@javicalle I can probably work on a PR in that way if you feel like it would be beneficial.

That would be an alternative approach to my `ep_attribute` overwrite with the same benefits (or even more).
