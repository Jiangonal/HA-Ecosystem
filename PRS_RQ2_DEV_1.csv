It has been a long time since I created this pull request.
Is it still planned / in progress to be integrated or is it abandonned ?

I am not used to homeassistant's project delays so I find it quite long but I understand also there is a lot of activity to manage on the project.

I integrated all of your points. I did some tests and a few corrections to make it work.

Issue,cnico,"Hi @frenck 
I corrected the points you reviewed.
After reading many times your last point on unique_id and removal problem, I finally understood that the problem is related to using a list of flipr ids in one config flow. So I fall back to my previous implementation that manages it by asking the user to choose the correct flipr_id in a select box through a second step when the user has more than one flipr (rare case).
I also corrected the problem detected by the CI bot. It should pass at next run.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

Issue,elupus,"I think you got the description mostly correct.

async_unload_entry will be called of you ask to reload or disable a config entry. It should first ask all platforms (cover, switch, ...) to unload (which will remove all entites, calling the will remove callback on all entities registered on that config entry and platform). Once that is complete, the integration async_unload_entry will (should) continue to disconnect any connections and remnant state of the integration.

It should be done in this order to avoid any entities being dependent on unloaded global state/connections.

Because the device tells me only the IP address.

Review,ivgg-me,"> This overwrite any required field invalid errors from above.

This is intentional, because the device can also be discovered using zeroconf, but this will be implemented in a later version of the integration.

If the device is discovered using zeroconf, only the IP address is known first, the other data (API Secret Key and API Auth Key) must be given by the user. The idea was that in this case only the error message _Please complete the setup of your Remootio device._ with key `user_input_incomplete` would be presented to the user.",2022-01-01T19:26:01Z,,ivgg-me,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63155,False,False

The constant `CONF_API_SECRET_KEY` is used in the voluptuous schema based on which the form for configuring the integration is presented to the user.

I implemented this because, according to the [documentation](https://github.com/remootio/remootio-api-documentation/blob/master/websocket_api_v3_specification.md), the device automatically closes an unauthenticated session after 30 seconds.

In the method `utils.create_client` an instance of the `RemootioClient` class is instantiated, whereby a connection to the device is also established and, among other things, the authentication takes place. - The library [_aioremootio_](https://pypi.org/project/aioremootio/), which contains the class `RemootioClient`, was also written by me.",2022-01-01T20:04:25Z,,ivgg-me,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63155,False,False

I don't understand why I should use a DataUpdateCoordinator here?

After a time that can be configured via the Remootio app, the device triggers a `LEFT_OPEN` event if the controlled garage door or garden gate has been left open. This event is received by the `RemootioClient` and calls the listener `RemootioCoverEventListener` for it, which in turn triggers a `remootio_left_open` Home Assistant event.",2022-01-01T20:32:08Z,,ivgg-me,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63155,False,False

Review,ivgg-me,"> Can't really await a property? Futures are also not safe to await from multiple tasks if this happen to be a future.

When instantiating the `RemootioClient` class, a lot of steps happens:
1. a connection is established to the device;
2. the [authentication](https://github.com/remootio/remootio-api-documentation/blob/master/websocket_api_v3_specification.md#7-auth-frame-and-the-authentication-flow) takes place (whereby the current status of the device is also found out);
3. a [HELLO frame](https://github.com/remootio/remootio-api-documentation/blob/master/websocket_api_v3_specification.md#hello-frame) is sent to the device and the response is awaited to find out the serial number of the device and the API version used by the device;
4. two asynchronous tasks are started to send [PING frames](https://github.com/remootio/remootio-api-documentation/blob/master/websocket_api_v3_specification.md#ping-frame) to the device and to receive and handle frames from the device.

The whole of the above initialization process takes place partly asynchronously and is encompassed by a [`Lock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Lock). When the (asynchronous) property `initialized` is queried, it is queried whether this `Lock` is active, and if so, the unlocking of it is awaited and only then the value of the property is returned.",2022-01-01T21:46:05Z,,ivgg-me,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63155,False,False
Review,elupus,I understand that. I just don't think this should be a property. It looks confusing.

First of all I do understand it's Christmas right now and I don't expect an immediate review. You can tell that since I've waited over two months without pinging anyone.
Please, don't use such a convenient excuse for not reviewing something when there's proof all over HA that some contributions take insane amounts of time to be reviewed... Specially since well, you're using the fact that it's Christams to make me the bad guy here and that's not fair...

Anyway, I'll wait without pinging anyone or eventually close this since apparently only contributions made by the core members of this project are reviewed/merged in a reasonable time, as opposed to contributions made by third parties, which  can be delayed forever if none reviews them...",2021-12-26T15:48:21Z,,Noltari,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/58053,True,True

@frenck It would be great to dedicate more free time to help in Home Assistant if I didn't have more open sources projects to contribute to such as OpenWrt or Linux. However, my free time is scarce because my main work isn't related to Open Source projects and for other personal reasons.
I was just stating that this project has a problem that needs to be solved as I've done before. If you don't want to see that and not review someone which is stating a problem that's fine, you're just harming third parties which might be interested in having this integration.

I removed the part which I assume you're taking as personal and leaved the rest. If you're taking anything else in that statement as personal please quote it, since I don't think it's violating any CoC now, but I could be wrong.
Yes, I admit I can be wrong sometimes. People should also do that more often :).

Anyway, as I already said I suggest you guys should take actions so that it doesn't take months to have a simple review because I love this project, but as any other project it has issues, and some of them need to be corrected as soon as possible...

There isn't much action to take. We can't force people to help out doing review. People in general simply like to submit PRs (which is great as well, but doesn't reduce the review queue).

Issue,ssaenger,I incorporated @bdraco 's suggestions and added an extra verification to determine that the correct connection was made. I changed the way entities are registered. Previously it would register all possible entities and disable the ones that are not usable. Now I only register usable entities. This makes the end-user experience better because the user's screen isn't populated with 18 different entities when most likely they would only use 6 of them.,2022-01-30T17:32:22Z,,ssaenger,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56094,True,True
Issue,ssaenger,"- Incorporated @bdraco 's suggestions.
- Increased poll time from 10 (default) to 30 seconds. I felt like 10 seconds is too fast to poll the state, and if user makes a change to a zone in home assistant, the amp state is updated immediately.
- Set default zone names. If this was not done, user would not be able to select zones until user configured it through an options flow.
- Disable polling and set device state to unavailable if amplifier turns off at anytime. This is to prevent logs from filling with error messages, and to save on resources.",2022-02-03T02:56:57Z,,ssaenger,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56094,True,True

Issue,ssaenger,"Added coordinator to retrieve data and update my entities. I call `self.schedule_update_ha_state(True)` when a service is called (such as ""set volume"") to tell HA to pull data from the WS66i amp in order to update my states. However, sometimes there is a big delay between when `self.schedule_update_ha_state(True)` is called and when data is pulled, so there are times where there is a big delay from when the user changes a state to when lovelace updates the state. It seems like HA is throttling my calls to `self.schedule_update_ha_state(True)`. Unfortunately this makes for a bad user experience.

I still need to test shutting off my amp while integration is active...

Edit: Maybe I can bypass the coordinator and have my entity update its own state and alert HA that state was changed. This way I can avoid the long delays with `self.schedule_update_ha_state(True)`.",2022-03-16T03:17:15Z,,ssaenger,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56094,True,True
Issue,ssaenger,"I am confident that commands sent off to the WS66i amp will be accepted, so my entity class will update its state and alert HA by calling `self.async_write_ha_state()`. This will provide immediate feedback to the end-user, and won't poll the amp each time the user makes a change through HA.

Since pyws66i returns a ZoneStatus class, my entities will reference that instead of copying those values locally. This means I brought back some `@property` attributes as they will need to read from the ZoneStatus class.

I've added coordinator handling to close the WS66i connection if the data pipeline breaks (such as the amp powered off) and on subsequent coordinator updates, it will retry to establish a connection.

I made the fields in the options flow required. If the user were to not provide a value in a config flow, that user would not be able to select a source through HA. This is undesired and required additional error checking in a few other places. This is especially problematic if the user selected a source via the keypad that wasn't configured in the config flow. By making them mandatory, the user has the freedom to select all available sources and some error checking was no longer needed, simplifying code.",2022-03-20T21:25:18Z,,ssaenger,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56094,True,True

Issue,ssaenger,"Sorry, I was getting ahead of myself. I was trying to continue to make improvements during a PR and that just makes it more difficult for you, the reviewer.

About custom services, these services should stay however; they are vital components to the integration. A basic automation will, for example, listen for an event, such as a doorbell rang event, snapshot the zones, play a notification indicating someone is at the door, and then restore the zones. In this use case, the snapshot will no longer be needed because a new snapshot will be taken whenever a notification needs to be played. Come to think of it, snapshots don't need to be in non-volatile memory at all.

I won't be making any more changes. In a future PR, I'll look into discovery. I hope this is acceptable.",2022-03-21T05:44:36Z,,ssaenger,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56094,True,True

I suggest to just have patience. You can always create a custom component with the same code if you need to run it in the meantime until it is part of the main code stream. 

I don’t know if a way to rush this. It was frustrating to me as well in the beginning, but it is just the way it is. They have a set number of developers and the community may be more active than this. ",2022-12-03T06:15:11Z,,Rudd-O,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77188,True,False

Excluding tests and non-Python code, this integration adds 1280 lines of code, and a substantial amount of that is just boilerplate required to fit the HASS standards (378 lines alone are in config flow dot py).

Issue,ziv1234,"there are a couple of options you can do:
1. the most straightforward is to think of some initial, limited functionality in the first PR, then add the additional ones in future PRs. Surely, there is a partial usage that will already give some, although not all, of the value. This will likely reduce your config_flow and other hass parts that will be deferred to the next PRs. Once you have the framework with minimum functionality, adding the additional ones will require smaller PRs that will get faster reviews
2. If the absolute MVP still requires a large amount of code, they have options to set a side branch, which can have multiple PRs. Each one can be small and implement a part, and it will only be released when you feel it is ready.

When I released the Dynalite integration, initially it only had lights, which is very limited. Switches, blinds, and other functionality was added in later PRs. When working on the first one, I learned some of their coding standards and built a good alignment with the reviewer, so the future ones were much quicker.",2022-12-05T16:21:26Z,,Rudd-O,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77188,True,False

Review,Rudd-O,"The thing is, this code (casting certs and keys from bytes to objects) is _only_ needed because HASS insists on storing strings / bytes -- the integration only deals in actual typed Python objects, like `Certificate` and `Key`.  Short of moving these casting functions into helpers within the client, this actually belongs here and not in the MPRIS client.  All of the logic of actually obtaining the certificate and pairing with the remote end is fully sealed up in the MPRIS client.

Review,bdraco,"While we want to store configuration data in the config entry, certificates are a bit large to put in there since everything has to be serialized to JSON and back.  Config entry storage isn't a database so every time its loaded/saved all the data for all the config entries has to be processed.

You can storage large data in `.storage`

You can accomplish this in two different ways.

You can pass the storage path to the library with `hass.config.path`. `git grep` for a few examples in the code base, and let it be responsible for reading the certificates from disk (in the executor please!)

Also you can use `homeassistant.helpers.storage` to store the certificates.  There is an example in `homekit` for aid storage.

I almost always prefer the solution that has the least code in HA itself and offloads that to the PyPI package code since it reduces the review time to make changes to an integration and keeps things moving along.",2022-08-29T21:27:15Z,,Rudd-O,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77188,True,False

Issue,02JanDal,"@davet2001 I've been in contact with @DasBasti as we've both been working on an integration for Sungrow inverters in parallel. As he was further ahead with the integration itself and the process of getting it reviewed and merged while my backing library was more advanced we decided to work together already as part of this PR, since it was not yet merged. As such I have modified Bastians code to use my library.

A review of these changes would be greatly appreciated!",2023-02-06T20:36:14Z,,DasBasti,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71526,False,False

Issue,02JanDal,"@davet2001 Thanks for taking the time!

Here is a diff of just the changes to this integration I've made: https://gist.github.com/02JanDal/7c0d50e191e6bc74422a6c81ac6e1282
Note that it excludes changes in generated files like requirements and CODEOWNERS, as those also include changes from other commits so are harder for me to isolate.

The file with the most significant changes is [`__init__.py`](https://gist.github.com/02JanDal/7c0d50e191e6bc74422a6c81ac6e1282#file-sungrow-diff-L1-L284), as my library is async (although not 100% until HA switches to pymodbus 3 but that has to wait for upstream and the modbus integration) I had to move some stuff out of the SungrowData constructor into `async_setup_entry`. It also contains some aspects in `SungrowCoordinatorEntity` previously found in `sensor.py`, which is mostly just a preparation for more entity types (which I've got ready locally but will be part of a future PR).

[`config_flow.py`](https://gist.github.com/02JanDal/7c0d50e191e6bc74422a6c81ac6e1282#file-sungrow-diff-L285-L368) should be functionally equivalent.

[`const.py`](https://gist.github.com/02JanDal/7c0d50e191e6bc74422a6c81ac6e1282#file-sungrow-diff-L369-L588) lost the sensor definitions, I moved them into `sensor.py`, again as it makes more sense to me once more entity types are there.

[`sensor.py`](https://gist.github.com/02JanDal/7c0d50e191e6bc74422a6c81ac6e1282#file-sungrow-diff-L608-L1075) gained the sensor definitions, quite a few more as my library supports more, while also losing some details in them (like device class and unit) that I instead compute inside of `SungrowCoordinatorEntity` based on the metadata in `pysungrow`.

In the tests the changes are almost exclusively about changing what is mocked, I did however introduce a [fixture](https://gist.github.com/02JanDal/7c0d50e191e6bc74422a6c81ac6e1282#file-sungrow-diff-L1207-L1231) that takes care of the patching that is done for most tests, as well as creating and registering the config entry.

Other than that it's of course quite a few import changes, as well as some adaptions to changes in the HA API, like using `SensorDeviceClass` instead of strings and going from `async_setup_platforms` to `async_forward_entry_setups`.",2023-02-10T07:02:47Z,,DasBasti,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71526,False,False

Tbh I wouldn't agree with such an approach at all. The extra effort would be pure waste, especially since you end up cleaning up the old stuff anyway. I'd rather see a clean and fast path forward to the API version without any legacy to hold you back.

Issue,ollo69,"Let me just make some consideration on this PR and all the others that involve AsusWRT integration on which I'm code owner.
Original AsusWRT integration have some issue with new Asus firmware / router, partially fixed with some improvement in original AioAsusWrt library based on telnet / ssh. Because with new firmware Asus released new API based on HTTP, new library based on new API  becomes available.

On May 2022 I created PR #71899 with the scope to extend the AsusWRT integration with the new HTTP protocol. This integration was ignored for many months by HA teams (I was thinking because it's to big), so I put that PR in draft and create the new PR #84152 with the scope to partially implement the previous one to give the ability to integrate new libraries in the original integration. In the meantime I also created a [custom integration](https://github.com/ollo69/ha_asuswrt_custom) that is a copy of the first PR and that I'm using from months without any issue.

Honestly I don't really like the idea to have 2 integrations for the same device, this will probably create a lot of confusion to the users. And the old integration cannot be simply removed, because old routers that do not implement HTTP API still need that version. 

But I really think that have new HTTP protocol available for new Asus routers is important, a well working device tracker is one of the most important part of Home Automation. So I hope that HA Teams will take one of this PRs in charge to better support one of te most used router.

@ScottG489, as I have asked you on the Community forum, it would be nice to get from you at least some information about the device you are using (model and FW version), as well as some other details about the device settings.

AsusWRT firmware has some problems which might provide performance issue on the integration side - e.g. with hanging the connection sessions instead of closing or reporting them.

In order to help with your issue (and any other issue with AsusRouter custom integration), I need to be able to diagnose and troubleshoot which exactly part is not working properly ",2023-06-25T10:53:17Z,,Vaskivskyi,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86084,False,False

Review,Vaskivskyi,"Hello and thanks for your feedback!

Yes, your suggestion is good. But this would require splitting the configuration for login/password (which will be handled by the re-auth flow and for which ConfigEntryAuthFailed can be raised properly) from the SLL / port settings as they are now.

Also, the credentials on the router do not expire as happens with some connected services and so on. The user needs to do this manually from the same menu as changing port/SSL - this was a part of the motivation to put them all together.

This can be implemented at the next step as a new feature and will help make the integration better. For now, I would prefer to keep the proposed code as small as possible, so the Core maintainers will be able to review it and approve it (if they find it correct and suitable).

Issue,homeassistant,"Hello @al-s,

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:

- [`a3ec34d0533836cbc129cea93741b840614b8bc9`](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;home-assistant&#x2F;core&#x2F;pull&#x2F;66130&#x2F;commits&#x2F;a3ec34d0533836cbc129cea93741b840614b8bc9) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (alexs@pushok.com). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

Review,ScottG489,"I can see where you're coming from with having to jump back and forth. I think it's more important to keep the `async_step` methods as readable as possible though. That's where the high level logic is and all the form definitions makes it much more difficult to grok. Also having all the form definitions encapsulated in these methods makes it easier to reference.

As a new contributor myself, it was really difficult to read through a lot of config flows for reference because they didn't abstract away a lot of higher level behavior.

Review,ScottG489,"For readability I personally prefer using a sentinel value to short circuit. At least in this situation. There's less indentation and as you read the method from top to bottom there's less mental overhead since you can just forget what's above the short circuit conditional. In this situation it also reads more linearly since when running through the flow `user_input` being none is what happens first.

That said, I always thought it was pretty convoluted how flow steps were mixed like this. Now that I'm a little more familiar with the framework, I've made a refactor where the initial step is by itself. All the `user_input is None` checks kinda seem like an anti-pattern that's propagated the codebase.

Neato and Vorwerk Vacuum cleaners are both based on `pybotvac` and act the same way. The only difference is the authentication flow.
My idea was to just copy the neato integration and fix the authentication flow. But after all the reviews it's a whole new integration that has nothing to do with the neato anymore. 

Please don't get me wrong all review findings were correct and the code is better now. But now it is no longer a fork of the neato integration. It is more a recode of it and that was not my intention when I started this PR.

Maybe it is a better idea to add the Vorwerk-Auth0 authentication to the neato integration. @dshokouhi and @Santober what do you think about this idea? Could you help me?

The ConfigFlow in this PR works for over one year now and I also have a working `pybotvac` patch, where the `PasswordlessSession` is based on the `OAuthSession`, that should work with Home Assistant like the neato `OAuthSession`. 

What I'm not familiar with is the Home Assistant oauth2 token handling. Who could help me with that part?

Review,autinerd,"It's no problem 😊 we are there to help! And no need to be overwhelmed, you can address the points step by step if you want to.

Normally the API provider has some terms of use. And some have a clause that in order to use the API you need to credit them, in some cases even writing what you should use as an attribution. But when there is no such clause, it is not needed. ",2024-03-07T11:05:17Z,,mexx42,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/112511,True,False

Review,mexx42,"Thanks for your answers, on the page they say that one can use the API for free with fair-use (max. 100 queries a day). Thats why i only query every hour. So i think i can remove the attribution.

But, is there is a way to query the api once on integration start and then every day at 14:00 + some random delay as the data only changes at 14:00 ? and how would this be implemented ?

Another question regarding entity-id's: mine look this: 

`sensor.energy_market_price_current_hour`

whereas easyenergy's integration entity is: 

`sensor.easyenergy_today_energy_usage_current_hour`

Shouldn't they be unique (to have all energy providers providing the same entity-ids, but then you cannot have more than one energy provider) ? 

Or should i add `awattar_` to the entity-id to distinguish them so that every integration providing energy data has different - and unique entity-id's ?

I think the other points (except testing) i already solved thanks to your suggestions :)",2024-03-07T13:21:14Z,,mexx42,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/112511,False,False

I think it would be good for the code owner to make it as a custom integration even just for testing. When I have created custom integrations while I waited for core PRs to get merged, it made testing changes a lot easier, as people could immediately try them out.

But the problem isn't code review hell or over bearing devs. The problem is there are a massive amount of PRs and not enough core devs to handle them, they have to prioritize and letting any code with flaws in will only make more PRs in the future or make PRs more complicated.

nah ive seen plenty of PRs get trashed over and over by the smallest things that dont really matter. this PR is nothing. It follows a basic pattern all integrations do. There area lot of PRs for sure but nitpicking to death doesnt do this repo any favors. I couldnt count how many times ive seen conflicting comments or a slew of comments just to be fllowed by a slew of more comments later on. At least i can take this PR and make my own custom integration with it cause id bet 100% right now this PR will sit here for a loooong time till the dev gets tired of dealing with it. see it happen all the time. peace out.",2023-05-30T03:33:29Z,,ryanbdclark,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93604,False,False

Issue,ProstoSanja,"> I would prefer the device name over the hostname for the entry title. I think that's a more user friendly way, but it depends on the context
  
Just a bit confused by what you mean by device name here, the information I am sending to hass is the following:  
1. manufacturer: Komfovent
2. model: C60
3. friendly name: set by user in the native webUI
4. serial number
  
So which one of these should be entry name?  
if we are talking about friendly name, which i just now set as device name, is it being duplicate okay? And what if it changes outside of hass, will it be picked up?  ",2023-10-31T20:44:57Z,,ProstoSanja,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95722,False,False

My concern is that at some point between the old integration being written and now, Leviton changed the format of the API key the device firmware expects, and the API key is stored in the old `configuration.yaml` files. Anything ported from the old integration to this new one would need to be re-added or at the very least re-authenticated.

My devices were already on the most recent version of the firmware when I bought them and everything I was able to find about connecting to the devices since the firmware upgrade required repairing the devices.

If the firmware us user upgradeable, I don't see any problems with requiring the user to do a firmware upgrade. If you can't test it yourself, I'd suggest to block old firmware already in the config flow if possible, and just ask the user to upgrade the device.",2023-11-28T08:39:34Z,,ColinCampbell,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96722,True,False
Issue,ColinCampbell,Ok so I think this is ready for review again :) Sorry for the delays. I've implemented the changes to (a) move the new code into the main decora integration and (b) implement the import of the configuration.yaml based config into the ConfigFlow based config. I have config_flow.py fully unit tested but I had a hard time testing the import flow manually. I added the config to the configuration.yaml but I couldn't get it to trigger the import flow as far as I could test but it did toss an error out saying that the configuration needed to move to the Config Flow based version.

Issue,Lektrico,"> The library uses Pydantic and there are 2 things wrong with it:
> 
> 1. The library should declare its dependencies, because now its hoping another integration uses pydantic and it would work. But this can cause issues.
> 2. We are slowly migrating to pydantic v2 ([Pydantic v2 migration issue #99218](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/99218)). Your library seems to use pydantic v2. I personally think we should not merge libraries using V1 without having support for the V2 shims. (checkout the issue for an explanation)
> 
> Also, if you add a `py.typed` file you can get rid of all the `int()`, `str()` and `float()` in `sensor.py`

The lektricowifi library uses 3 dependencies (aiohttp, async_timeout, yarl).

Issue,emontnemery,"@stefano055415 something went wrong with your merge / rebase, can you try to fix that?

A simple way to recover can be the following flow:
- Update `dev` on your local fork to match upstream
- Rename your local `freedompro` branch to `freedompro_old`
- Create and checkout a new `freedompro` branch off `dev`
- Cherry-pick the relevant commits from `freedompro_old` tp `freedompro`
- Force-push the `freedompro` branch, this PR will then point to the new `freedompro` branch

For the future, this is a good guide for a simple workflow which will always work: https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962",2021-06-30T09:32:40Z,,stefano055415,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/46332,True,True

Issue,emontnemery,"@stefano055415 Now it does indeed look fine again 👍

Just a question, should the light work in ""optimistic"" mode or not?
Optimistic means Home Assistant assumes an attempt to turn on or off the light was successful, and should mainly be used in cases where the device or service doesn't push updates and where it's also not possible to request a state update.

It's preferred to not use optimistic mode when not necessary.

Optimistic:
```py
    async def async_turn_off(self, **kwargs):
        """"""Async function to set off to light.""""""
        self._attr_is_on = False
        payload = {""on"": False}
        payload = json.dumps(payload)
        await put_state(
            self._session,
            self._api_key,
            self._attr_unique_id,
            payload,
        )
```

Non optimistic:
```py
    async def async_turn_off(self, **kwargs):
        """"""Async function to set off to light.""""""
        payload = {""on"": False}
        payload = json.dumps(payload)
        await put_state(
            self._session,
            self._api_key,
            self._attr_unique_id,
            payload,
        )

I could pick that up if it would be helpful.

Regarding putting it in `dyson_local` vs `dyson`, I think it's worth pointing out that there is a `dyson_local` and a `dyson_cloud`. The existing integration was sort of both to some extent.

Some people reported being able to use the old integration by signing in on the mobile app just before or something like that at some point, but I think the analytics mostly report that because nobody is able to use it anymore, confirming that it's entirely broken today.

Thanks for your reply
My development environment is set on a devcontainer using docker and VSC following the instruction you mentioned.
However I struggled at the beginning because of the docker came with early version of python 3 and many dependency were not working, I had to manually build python3.9 and install all the deps - hope there's a easy solution for this.

second question, say I fixed some issue on the code, do I have to push another commit? can't I just ammend a patchset to the PR (like Gerrit)?? --- sorry but I am new to github :)

The dev container comes with it's own python, you don't need to install python on the host system. It looks like something did not work for you on the initial installation. 

Try running `pre-commit`, if it doesn't run your installation probably did not finish successfully.

Issue,cibernox,"Thanks for the review @farmio 

PH changes quite often but not drastically if we check the 2nd decimal point (e.g. 7.21 to 7.22) as electrolysis is a chemical process that naturally raises PH, and this kind of chlorinators have a peristaltic pump that liberates PH reductor in the flow to counter that effect.

I left the 30 seconds interval because it's the default. Coincidentally I sniffed packages in my local network using wireshark to check how often the chlorinator sends updates to the platform and it's around 30 seconds too (unless there's user interaction, in which case it does immediately). I can make it a minute if that's a concern.

However what can change quickly is the state of the binary inputs and relays of the chlorinator, which I removed from this initial PR to comply with the ""one platform per pull-request"" policy, but as soon as this one is merged I'll open more PRs adding other platforms.

Considering other platforms will be added, maybe 30s is not too much.

Review,allenporter,"Have you considered not using `DiscoveryService` at all and directly implementing `Listener` here?  It seems like the code can get simpler by inlining some of these calls and just implementing `Listener` in each place you want to listen to an event.

For example, my impression is that `Listener.controller_discovered` is invoked on the first time you add a `Listener`, this you don't need to both loop over the existing found controllers.

This then becomes something like this:
```
async def async_setup_entry(...):
    class InitListener:
        def controller_discovered(self, ctrl: Controller) -> None:
            async_add_entities([ControllerDevice(ctrl)])

  pi_disco = hass.data[PI_DISCO]
  pi_disco.add_listener(InitListener())

```

",2021-10-12T05:38:06Z,,lazdavila,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56039,True,True
Review,allenporter,"My impression from reading the pescea library is that the `Controller` itself knows about the state change, then it has to notify the `DiscoveryService` which then invokes the `DiscoveryService` in home assistant, which then fires an event that notifies the `ControllerDevice` which compares back with the original `Controller`.

You might find this gets simpler to avoid the global dispatch by having a listener on the `Controller` itself, rather than via the discovery services and notifications. That way a `ControllerDevice` could call `add_listener` on the `Controller` and have fewer comparisons to make.

It also seems like you could also get away with a single event, for what its worth, and just checking the current state of to determine if `_attr_available` needs updating. Having multiple callbacks still results in 3 very similar looking callback methods.

I realize the existing integration this is modeled after does this, but its not clear to me its necessary so i thought i'd suggest these ideas for simplifying further.",2021-10-12T05:44:49Z,,lazdavila,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/56039,True,True
Review,allenporter,"The most common way this handled seems to be to do all the setup in `async_setup_entry` and tear down in `async_unload_entry` only.  To me this seems more straight forward than having these method methods that store state in `hass.data` which are called from a few places.  I think [gree](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/c68b259bd3e43d77fe9b9d47c768f9aa6198571e/homeassistant/components/gree/__init__.py#L26) is a good example.

As an example, unload happens both from the home assistant stop event and from unloading the config entry and it just makes it a little harder to reason about.

The downside of this is that the config entry and the setup entry do not share the same discovery services, but i think thats ok since config flows are a fairly rare event.  (gree also has a nice interface for initial device discovery in the config flow as well with its `scan` which is nice too fwiw)

- [`c5c2cf143881e8a8521137343e09230edf744cf6`](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;home-assistant&#x2F;core&#x2F;pull&#x2F;44929&#x2F;commits&#x2F;c5c2cf143881e8a8521137343e09230edf744cf6) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (git@billystevenson.co.uk). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

You are correct. In fact, meater-python (the library which this integration uses in the backend to handle comms to the API) already supports obtaining cook information. But [as-per the home assistant dev docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_component_code_review#5-make-your-pull-request-as-small-as-possible), this initial pull request is limited to the most basic functionality. Once it's accepted, a separate pull request should be made to add the cook information to HA. I believe @brg468 has already made a start on this, so he might want to raise a PR when the time is right, but if not then it's definitely on my radar to add. There's been a lot of activity on this recently, so hopefully, it won't be too long until it's accepted and more functionality can be added!

This is a backport from cpython 3.12

https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-policy.html
> PidfdChildWatcher is a “Goldilocks” child watcher implementation. It doesn’t require signals or threads, doesn’t interfere with any processes launched outside the event loop, and scales linearly with the number of subprocesses launched by the event loop. The main disadvantage is that pidfds are specific to Linux, and only work on recent (5.3+) kernels.

@matthuisman thats exactly what you can do now if you already have CT clamps on your power (how I'm using it now) I've moved further development into a HACS compatible repo https://github.com/mikey0000/ha-electric-kiwi where I'm tracking issues and feature requests, so feel free to add that as a feature. EK's power usage doesn't update in real time enough AFAIK to provide hourly KW/h usage. At least comparing it to my CT clamps it updates every day or so.

I'll open new PR's into core once this is merged.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting ""Author Name"" and ""`email@address.com`"" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

basic balance sensor for Electric Kiwi

add in logger and a few other possibly required imports

pinning dependencies and adding integration type

Fix copy/paste documentation errors

Add in auth2 flow and make updates to various flows

fix a few PR issues raised with duplicate consts and an import and an issue with basic auth

Add unique id and fix issue with initial call for connection id and customer number

Use NAME const and remove commented out code and consts

Move scope values to const

Tests pass for auth flow

Sort out tests, owners, coverage and rebasing

change to production url

add in missing reauth strings

if somehow the token is valid but the request fails raise catch the error and re-auth on set active session

move to async forward entry setups as per warning

use correct account balance

make the entities easier to extend and add one more

Add a few more entities and correctly classify them into their classes

no need for private async update now

24 hours is a bit too long, every 6 hours seems more reasonable for keeping it up to date.

move to using data coordinator pattern

move the coordinator to its own file

add select and seperate sensor entity for the start time of HOP

update manifest with latest version of the API

add electric kiwi to the strict and mypy configs

add in end time and tidy up what unique id returns and bump version of api for model fixes

address the checklist and remove account balance over hop as hop is more useful

address mypy issues

address comments and a few more tidy ups, accidentally removed async entry so restored that too

remove homekit item from manifest

I know 3 months seems like a long time to get an integration in. There are PRs that remain open for a year before merging.

Issue,derjoerg,"Hi,
integration works perfect. Just two questions:
1. I saw that power1-3 are disabled by default, but I see no possibility in the device-config to enable them (I don't have them listed). Is this the intended behaviour?
2. I have a sensor called ""Total Production"", which shows - since the beginning - 0,2021001 kWh. What is the meaning of this sensor? (btw I don't produce energy)

Nevertheless,
Thanks for this integration and crossing fingers, that it will soon become official.

> 1. I saw that power1-3 are disabled by default, but I see no possibility in the device-config to enable them (I don't have them listed). Is this the intended behaviour?

You should have an option called ""+3 hidden entities"" under the sensors, if you click on it, it will expand and you will see the 3 disabled entities. If you click on one of it, it will open a modal with additional settings where you can enable it.

Discovergy usually installs a 2-way meter suitable for solar production. Since I cannot distinguish whether you are producing energy or not when the  integration gets activated, the total production sensor is activated by default. You can deactivate it in the same way as you activate a sensor.",2022-04-07T09:35:26Z,,jpbede,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/54280,True,True

In the PR you mentionned `ScannerEntity` only but the change being applied at the `BaseTrackerEntity` level makes it apply to `TrackerEntity` too. Was this desired behaviour? I was quite pleased to have a device associated to my tracker but if this is not desired anymore I will simply remove `device_info` from my integration.

Issue,ezlo-picori,"Hi,

The way dates are returned by the API is not always consistent. I did apply a fix for this in version 0.7.1 of the underlying python package to communicate with the API but did not upgrade the integration to use this updated version.
As a temporary fix, simply change the `requirements_all.txt` file to use `gps-tracker==0.7.1` instead of `gps-tracker==0.7.0` and hopefully it will do the trick.

I will push the fix on this PR this evening when I'll be at home.

Issue,VederJay,"Thanks for your response! 
Not sure how you think I'm doing this but I just downloaded the files from the integration and put them in custom_components. I've updated the requirement in the manifest, deleted the python lib that Home Assistant had downloaded and restarted HA. When I tried adding the integration again, HA downloaded v0.7.1 of the Python library and now I've got a device!

I'm only getting the single device though, while I have 3 trackers linked to the same account. Is this a limitation of the integration, or did something else go wrong? The log doesn't show any issues.

Issue,VederJay,"Hi, 

Do you have automatic updates of the location working? I didn't get them (or I was not patient enough - maybe there's a refresh timeout?). 
I resolved it for myself by adding an automation that reloads the integration every three minutes. Although that does give me the most recent location quite speedily, the downside is that for some reason the location always goes ""unavailable"" during this process"":

To use an integration as a custom_component, you must add a `version` item in `manifest.json`, I guess you forgot that step?
Otherwise, I have no idea...

You may also take a look to https://github.com/timothyle97/Invoxia-HA : @timothyle97 converted this pull request into a custom_component that you may directly copy into your home-assistant instance. See [here](https://github.com/timothyle97/Invoxia-HA/blob/main/custom_components/invoxia/manifest.json#L13) in particular if you need an example for the `manifest.json` tweaking.

Unfortunately, I have lost hope about this PR being accepted one day so using a custom component might be the best approach...

> Oops, typo. Corrected. Thanks for catching. But it's still a valid question as those two sensors accounted for around half of all data in my HA database.

Yeah, agreed. Wind direction for me is less relevant. But wind speed is crucial. Sometimes a minute delay is too long and can cause serious damage. I get frequent wind which can spike very quickly. Being able to react to the first such spike is important as a full minute of sustained high winds can be disastrous. I guess the question is, should it be disabled by default with a note saying to enable it if you need it. Or should it be enabled by default with a note saying it may cause a large HA database and disable if unneeded?",2022-12-01T16:40:33Z,,jeeftor,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/75530,True,True

Review,gjohansson-ST,"Let's take air temp as example.
Let's say the device sends the information as 70 F and you have configured the sensor to be natively using F as unit.
Then HA will convert it for a metric user by itself to 21 C.
Now you're doing all kind of conversions to do that for the user when it should not be needed (HA will take care + the user can always change after).

Or can the device send different depending on the setting so you assume it's configured same as their HA? Can we then check that instead?",2023-08-05T19:47:04Z,,jeeftor,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/75530,True,True
Review,jeeftor,"So internally the backing library is using the pint class which has a ton of internal conversions:

https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/nonmult.html

Some of the sensor values are coming in in ""non-ha-supported"" units in some cases. We aren't actually ALWAYS doing the conversion.

In the case of any Temp sensors, however, we are not applying ANY conversion ... (as I hope to show)

```python
@dataclass
class WeatherFlowTemperatureSensorEntityDescription(WeatherFlowSensorEntityDescription):
    """"""Describes a WeatherFlow temperature sensor entity description.""""""

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        """"""Post initialisation processing.""""""
        self.native_unit_of_measurement = UnitOfTemperature.CELSIUS
        self.device_class = SensorDeviceClass.TEMPERATURE
        self.state_class = SensorStateClass.MEASUREMENT
        self.decimals = 1
```

This will just pull in the native `c` value off the sensor. I've rewritten the code a little bit to maybe make it more clearer.

So when we are in `def native_value(self) -> datetime | StateType:`


```python

        # Extract raw sensor data
        raw_sensor_data = getattr(
            self.device,
            self.entity_description.key
            if self.entity_description.attr is None
            else self.entity_description.attr,
        )
```

We get a Quantity & units value. 

![image](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/assets/6491743/33de67fa-6487-4737-ab20-749de391f49b)

Temperature sensors utilize HA conversion -> so it doesn't jump into the conversion block at all.

![image](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/assets/6491743/2b4c6bfe-ed35-479b-927a-52f070a02045)

In the next block it will just extract the sensor value and round it accordingly:

```python
        if isinstance(noramlized_sensor_data, Quantity):
            sensor_value = noramlized_sensor_data.magnitude
            if (decimals := self.entity_description.decimals) is not None:
                sensor_value = round(sensor_value, decimals)
            return sensor_value
```            

So it's just skipping over the logic (even though it is called) - and then all we are doing is parsing out the `sensor_value` and applying a rounding factor.


<br>

The few cases it does need to apply conversions is when its using Non-hA supported units in say `Air_Density`

Home Assistant natively doesn't support the values in question:

There is a conversion function which is applied - the native HA ones won't cut it ...

(I made a few rewrites after writing this to update variable names for clarity) ... happy to remove them and go back to the simpler version if you prefer but hopefully this explains some of the logic better.

In summary: -> We don't really have to do this that often, but sometimes its needed on the sensors...

It still takes advantage of the Native HA conversion when possible (like the temp example) where it will store the value in native in C allowing HA to handle the F conversion

Right, so if I _don't_ use `DataUpdateCoordinator` then I can't use `CoordinatorEntity` as the base for the entities. Which means I would need to reimplement the functionality for updating the entities. It seems like a lot of unnecessary re-implementation when the alternative is to just use library base classes.

Thanks for this feedback. I went ahead and made that change. I did need to lift `async_add_listener` and `async_update_listeners` to make this work. I removed anything but the bare minimum needed.",2023-11-29T23:48:22Z,,chamberlain2007,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95093,True,True

Nice, but there are several other places where you also use `data[Attribute.MAC_ADDRESS]` to create devices and so on.
You can just use the config entry's unique ID there instead.

Please take a look at that and mark the PR ready for review when done.

Also, after a reconnect to the device, I think it would be a good idea to check the MAC and call `self.config_entry.async_start_reauth(self.hass)` if not matching.

The Home Assistant team prefers starting an integration with a minimal set of functionality, hence this only containing the climate entity.

Review,chamberlain2007,"@IsakNyberg It's not ideal, but the reason is that the thermostats are very flaky, and too many socket requests in a short period of time can completely overload it and cause it to need a restart. Because I need to establish the connection to validate it during the config flow and then immediately let it disconnect, and then reconnect again right after when the integration is setup, I am concerned about overloading it.

Issue,Bouni,"@frenck You've said ([here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/59788#issuecomment-971721225)) that a integration for Luxtronik controllers should support all versions and you don't want to have seperate integartions vor different versions of that controller.
Do you still insist on that? We discussed if it would make sense to have both Luxtronik controller geneartions in the same integration and came to the conclusion that it doesn't make sense as the use a completely different protocoll and barely share the same functionality.
It would be awesome if you could give us some advice how to proceed!",2023-01-27T08:52:41Z,,BenPru,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86636,False,False

Review,akx,"This implies the duration always has two digits, which sounds like an assumption that could break at any point.

Additionally, this will happily match e.g. `""६೬,""` because of two bugs:

* You don't need commas in a character class.

DURATION_PATTERN = re.compile(r""^[0-9]+[SMH]$"")

how long is the queue?

sorry for the inpatience, was waiting a month for a approve of @emontnemery requestes changes, after three weeks i tried pinging @emontnemery  here and contacted him per mail after three weeks 

waited a another week -> got no response at all, i know i should be patience and not contact per mail but got no response for 4 weeks?

you @frenck  are at same company  or? could you ping/reach him? is he still alive?

created new MR only cause of getting no response at all
(a simple on vacation for two weeks, or no time next three weeks would be nice, so at least i know the status)

sorry for reopening if it really takes one month+ for reviewing i wasn't aware of that

Long, see the pull request tab. Everything is open source and depended on contributions. This include help with reviews. If you want things to go faster, please help out reviewing.

Please don't do that, see also the link I've send you above, there is a section in there on things **not** to do.

> you @frenck are at same company or? could you ping/reach him? is he still alive?

I work full time on Home Assistant, just like Erik. He is still alive, I will not ping him.

That makes no sense, as described above. Please don't do that. Have patience instead.

Hello @xeniter,

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:


- [`462c8edc0c2a804f8d8a8d612c37b4800122d0c1`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93750/commits/462c8edc0c2a804f8d8a8d612c37b4800122d0c1) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (manuel.dipolt@robart.cc). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.


Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting ""Author Name"" and ""`email@address.com`"" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

Issue,godely,"> I have a Dremel 3D printer so I will have to try this. For easier review, we ask that only one platform is in the initial PR. 100% test coverage is also required for `config_flow`. Thanks for your contribution!

@tkdrob It would be awesome if you could test it on your Dremel 3D Printer! Even more awesome if you hold the versions 3D20 or 3D40, which don't have camera, to see if the API works the same way as it does on the 3D45 model and it adds the same entities as it does for the 3D45 model except the Camera. Otherwise, having another pair of eyes testing it on the 3D45 model would be appreciated as well. Please let me know how that goes.

I've added the test coverage to `config_flow`, and left only the `Sensor` platform, as requested. Should I also remove the services added by this PR?

By the way, if you don't mind me asking, I've looked into the documentation but couldn't find directions on how to align this PR with the changes to __1.__ add documentation to Home Assistant docs and __2.__ add a logo for this integration on the Integrations UI. Can you link me to the documentation on how to do so or simply guide me on how can I make progress on that? I understand there are two different repos for docs and for logo respectively, but I'm lost as to how can I align PRs made to those repos with this PR, so that they are published together, or in other words, what's the correct order of repos that I should make changes to (adding docs first, then adding logo, then publishing this diff? Publishing this diff first? etc.)

Also, after this PR gets accepted, should I keep adding the other platforms to this same PR and asking for a new revision or open a new one?",2022-06-12T20:30:08Z,,godely,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72235,False,False

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

There is no documentation available yet, but you can take a look at all these PRs to give you an idea:
https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+entitydescription+in%3Atitle

Basically you assign `self.entity_description` to your sensor class, and you no longer need to set the `_attr_` attributes.

This is how it works internally for icons:

Yeah they can be hidden by default, except for total finds, and maybe the souvernirs? the other only make sense if you also hide caches",2022-05-12T08:55:21Z,,Sholofly,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/50284,True,True

The reasoning for me was: Total hides is not something that would/should show up on the default / auto-generated dashboard by default. Mainly because it depends if you hide caches, and if you do, that would not be something that changes a lot / adds values to a default dashboard.",2022-05-12T08:58:50Z,,Sholofly,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/50284,True,True

Yeah that's why we made them hidden by default. But, as you stated, that has disadvantages too. Is there a integration where a comparable choice is made? In that case I can agree with it.

Issue,homeassistant,"Hello @mtarjoianu,

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:

- [`879bf45c464dd5462943d2580bd9127a48d02c80`](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;home-assistant&#x2F;core&#x2F;pull&#x2F;60413&#x2F;commits&#x2F;879bf45c464dd5462943d2580bd9127a48d02c80) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (mihaela.tarjoianu@scada.ro). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

Issue,homeassistant,"Hello @mtarjoianu,

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:

- [`609c0a434744c8b1bd9dfbc959a68b10b73bb812`](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;home-assistant&#x2F;core&#x2F;pull&#x2F;60413&#x2F;commits&#x2F;609c0a434744c8b1bd9dfbc959a68b10b73bb812) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (mihaela.tarjoianu@yahoo.com). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

- Your PR replaces a component which will be kicked out of hass core soon. It would be good to point that out on Discord as well because IMHO the HomeAssistant core developers try to point our alternatives when kicking out stuff.

The data is exposed by an APi but the authentication and schema is a bit unique. 

The schema is like a CSV but using ~ as a comma and | as new line character. So i am just transforming it into a KVP. 

To get the API you have to first auth and second get a CRSF token. The only bit of screen scraping is getting the token. 

The token can be reused across a long lifetime, but it only allows one concurrent user, so if someone else was to log in then that session token gets expired. So i go through the auth process every time. Its a local device so it is extremely fast even though its three HTTPS calls. 

I think of it different than screen scraping because in the end it is an API and the device is owned by the user and it's in their home and under their control to update and operate. It feels different than hitting some public website owned by a third party to retrieve stock quotes or weather or something like that. 

I will work on the documentation and the pypi part

Can you give us an example of the raw data returned before the string clean up and parsing into the key value pair dict? Ie, what does `data_request_text` look like here?

Issue,mayberryjp,"Yeah it's like this from dev tools

first row of the CSV is the count of sensors i think (25)

next
- a number (usually 7 or 5 or 3 or 15)
- a unique number
- a name
- another number (3 or 2)
- a class of the measurement
- three values (only the third one ever has a value)
- the number 60 (don't know the meaning of it) - maybe the polling interval in seconds

Thanks. Right now the objective is getting the integration merged (no-score) and then aim for Silver and up.

Review,danzel,"Not quite. Airtouch 5 is a ducted AC system.
There is one physical AC unit (represented in HA as `Airtouch5AC`).
The air output of this unit is ducted in to multiple rooms, each of which has a damper (to control flow rate) and a temperature sensor. These are represented as an `Airtouch5Zone`.
A zone reports its current temperature, can be turned on and off individually, and you can set the target temperature for it individually.

In HA it ends up looking like:
![image](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/assets/393086/bd247c5d-6a8d-454a-8895-85cf8ea7e12c)

Issue,rianadon,"Hi @emontnemery. As I mentioned before I had held off implementing the state class for net meters because I was a bit confused how to proceed. Your comment helped clarify things, but I'm still facing an underlying problem caused by the Ted 6000 device resetting at inconsistent times.

I had asked on the discord and got no response, so I figure I'll ask here.

I've been running my changes with `last_reset` for a few weeks, and today I decided to create a statistics card for one for one of the net meters to check how they're working.

<img width=""503"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18223213/221823094-69eba23e-64a3-459b-b1fe-837262460353.png"">

This is what I got. Based on the form of the state measurement, the sum should be an ever-increasing line. However, it has jaggies because the time that the sensor resets is inconsistent. Sometimes it's at midnight, but other days it can be as far as five minutes behind.

As comparison, here's a non-net energy value that uses the `total_increasing` state class. Notice how the line is straight.

<img width=""403"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18223213/221829489-efa7b0ba-aa9b-4f49-8b88-699c4e4884dc.png"">


Is there any great way to handle the inconsistent reset times? And if not, I'm thinking that maybe I should not give these net entities a state class `measurement`. The Ted6000 also publishes historical data (for example what was the total net energy use 6 days ago). Perhaps I could use these to detect whether the day has rolled over, but it sounds like a lot of extra logic. Perhaps this is better left to a future PR? It would be great to get this work merged.",2023-02-28T10:37:48Z,,rianadon,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/82959,False,False
Issue,emontnemery,"> it has jaggies because the time that the sensor resets is inconsistent. Sometimes it's at midnight, but other days it can be as far as five minutes behind.

The problem is that you're trying to calculate the `last_reset` time based on the local time. That simply won't work, you need to either get the time from the API or detect that a new period has started and bump the last_reset only then.
An example of the former is if the API includes some meta data indicating for which date the reading is.

You can't imagine how excited i am. You are the first one using this integration. That feels marvelous :)

Regarding your question: While implementing the modbus client for the API i found two different docs describing the Modbus registers, formats and so one (just let me know and drop me a msg if you wan't me to share it with you) 
In the documentation i saw that some Modbus registers are only available for different device types. (This means some register are only available for VARTA element, some for VARTA pulse, some for VARTA link and so one)
Sadly i also found the documentation is not fully correct. For example i found some some file types are in the reality on my device different from the documentation and so one.
Long story short, there is unfortunately nothing you can do. I have on my side the same situation, the device is providing only the current production power of my panels and not the total one.

One thing you should check: When browsing on to the WebUI of your VARTA device, check if you configured your inverter connection in the settings (Energymanager => SunSpec-Manager)

Last but not least you will have the following option. After configuring your inverter-connection as described above you should see at least the current production power for your panels in HA,  you can use the the core integration ""Rieman sum integral"" (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/integration/) to generate a total value (per day/per week/..) for this

Hope this helps you. Just let me know if you have any further questions

Issue,mxwi,"Hi!
Happy to see your integration! I have some trouble with calculating total charge/discharge energy with the riemann integration (if interested: [[Riemann integration for discharge and loading behave different](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/riemann-integration-for-discharge-and-loading-behave-different/393003)](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/riemann-integration-for-discharge-and-loading-behave-different/393003)

Because of this I would be interested how you get on this values. I see you have values for total discharge and charge. As far as I know there is only a modbus register for the total charge energy (1069 lower / 1070 higher word on my Varta Element).

Hey, as you mentioned total charged energy is: 1069 lower / 1070 higher word.
For discharge the VARTA element only provide the current values:
- active power in W (1066, SINT16)

Issue,dr-waterstorm,"@Vip0r It would be awesome if you could also include the totals in the Varta integration. That way we could use it with the HA Energy functionality without using the Riemann integration.

However, I could not figure out a way to get them via modbus. But they can easily be pulled using the CGI from the webinterface:

```
curl -X GET http://Varta-IP/cgi/energy.js                                
EGrid_AC_DC = 147378;
EGrid_DC_AC = 24301;
EWr_AC_DC = 151225;
EWr_DC_AC = 120430;
Chrg_LoadCycles = [9];
```

Where 
EGrid_AC_DC == Grid -> Building (Wh)
EGrid_DC_AC == Home -> Grid (Wh)
EWr_AC_DC == Inverter AC -> DC == Total Charged (Wh)
EWr_DC_AC == Inverter DC -> AC == Total Discharged (Wh)
Chrg_LoadCycles == Charge Cycle Counter

In addition there is also the ""Service"" Endpoint available here:

```
curl -X GET http://Varta-IP/cgi/user_serv.js
FilterZeit = 5839;
Fan = 0;
Main = 1;
```

Which return the time in hours until the next service / maintenance of the filter. ",2022-02-22T11:45:29Z,,Vip0r,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63736,False,False

could you give me some background for this change request? As i forwarded the setup from the __init__.py to the sensor.py i thought it would be the right place to place the coordinator.

```bash
pytest ./tests/components/vartastorage/ --cov=homeassistant.components.vartastorage --cov-report term-missing -vv

The requirement will be fullfiled when you get as an answer

```

In the `test_config_flow.py`, you will find many `patch` context such as

```python3
    with patch(
        ""homeassistant.components.vartastorage.config_flow.PlaceholderHub.authenticate"",
        side_effect=CannotConnect,
    ):
        result2 = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_configure(
            result[""flow_id""],
            {
                ""host"": ""1.1.1.1"",
                ""username"": ""test-username"",
                ""password"": ""test-password"",
            },
        )
```

the `patch` context lets you change the output or behaviour of one function durint the execution of the context. You can use this to force your `hub.test_connection()` to raise `CannotConnect` and thus confirm that your `config_flow.py` does raise this error in case of connection error.
Similarly, the `test_form` method must check that the config_flow works correctly if everything goes well during the entry_setup.

In your case, you can completely drop the `test_form_invalid_auth` as there is no authentication involved in your entry (and thus you can remove 
```python
        except InvalidAuth:
            errors[""base""] = ""invalid_auth""
```
and the `InvalidAuth` class from `config_flow.py`
)

Thank you @Lash-L , there were a few things had missed along the way. Being challenged on a software design is a good thing, this was not an easy integration and this is probably the third iteration to get everything reliably working. Has been operating reliably for 5ish months now.

Hello @osohotwateriot,

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:


- [`f37e1d82bcd90e3439864dc64574c2f4a28bdbcb`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/70365/commits/f37e1d82bcd90e3439864dc64574c2f4a28bdbcb) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (marian.graurov@icbdigital.no). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.


Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting ""Author Name"" and ""`email@address.com`"" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting ""Author Name"" and ""`email@address.com`"" for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally. The best thing to come out of this is that you only need to fix this once and it benefits the entire Home Assistant and GitHub community.

Thanks, I look forward to checking this PR again soon! :heart:

Issue,greg-ha-1990,"> Thanks for your contribution! Initial review to get you started.
> 
> Have you tested this PR? Not sure if I overlook it, but doesn't seem you handle state updates / local polling anywhere?

This is a wifi to remote device, it can't actively know the state of the cover because there is no network connection between them, just as there is no way to ask the TV remote which channel is playing on the TV right now. We can only save the cached state values when actively controlling a wifi to IR device, and besides, cover can only be controlled by this IR device, so there's no ambiguity about it.

I have tested it and it works normally. The following is the test video I recorded, please refer to:

The ""leviosa zone"" is, as far as I can tell from examining mine, a repackaged IR blaster. It has a MAC address, and would require minimal effort on the part of the Leviosa team to add a sticker to it with the devices Mac address (or, worst case, users can just find it on their router as I have)

I didn't see this rule in the official recommended style. 

In fact, if you do a global search for the key word `: Final = ` in the core repository, you'll see that most of the results are within `const.py`.

![](https://jijiantuku-image.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/markdown_img/2024/04/17/20240417_085218_c93c9b93158827b1a5bd4fc51ca268f3.png)

I just looked for a few other integrations as a reference. I can easily find that their constants in `const.py` have only been imported once, such as:
`ATTRIBUTION` in [adobe](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/abode/const.py), which is only used in `__init__.py`, Another example is `ATTRIBUTION` in [aftership](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/aftership/const.py), which is only used by `sensor.py` . You can find tons of examples of this if you want.

It should be written in const.py as long as it has the `public` constant attribute, and if it has to be set to private after being imported only once, it will inevitably make maintenance difficult, because the entity code is iterated and may be maintained by different people, and in that case, it will inevitably need a public const.py to life the public constants, which is what most integrations do.",2024-04-17T00:53:52Z,,greg-ha-1990,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103683,False,False
Issue,emontnemery,"@greg-ha-1990 apart from the style issue about non shared constants in `const.py`, there are many other comments which you have not addressed.

Yes, other integrations may violate that rule, it doesn't mean it's OK to introduce further violations.

Review,greg-ha-1990,"Thank you for your suggestion.
My understanding is that since a leviosa shades can spawn multiple entities, this curtain controller is essentially a wifi to IR device, but it can control up to six groups of covers, so it will derive up to seven entities, such as `group1` - `group6` and `group_ALL`, so we need to call the `async_add_entities` method inside the `async_setup_entry` method, but obviously the `async_setup_entry` method in `__init__.py` doesn't have an `AddEntitiesCallback` parameter, so it's not possible to call `async_add_entities` inside `async_setup_entry` in __init__,py anymore.
I'm currently stuck at this point and don't know how to proceed from here, again I'll ask you for your advice, thanks!",2023-11-28T02:19:44Z,,greg-ha-1990,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103683,False,False

Review,greg-ha-1990,"We use the SSDP protocol for device discovery, and I know HA already supports SSDP-based auto-discovery, but I still prefer to put it inside leviosa_shades instead of reusing the public SSDP discovery functionality because I want to customize the presentation of the device discovery page in a way that can help users understand the difference between different leviosa shades, and I don't want to scatter discovered leviosa shades in a massive list of chanting HA auto-discovered devices; in fact, I'll even hit the `ignore all` button，And sometimes the public device discovery function cannot complete all device discovery well.

Can I keep it in my own integration?

This is why I was confused by no state in your integration. If you have a stateless integration (as you described in the reply, added below), your iot class is assumed state. See https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest/#iot-class.

> This is a wifi to remote device, it can't actively know the state of the cover because there is no network connection between them, just as there is no way to ask the TV remote which channel is playing on the TV right now. We can only save the cached state values when actively controlling a wifi to IR device, and besides, cover can only be controlled by this IR device, so there's no ambiguity about it.

Review,LennP,"DiceColorSensor, BatteryLevelSensor and DiceNumberSensor all have a `dice` class variable. Why don't you put it in BaseSensor? Then you can also remove the __init__ for each of these right?

And you can include the descriptions like below. Also small point but you write `async_add_entities(entries)` but you are really adding entities instead of entries, but that won't be a problem if you do it like this.
```python
    entities = [
        (DiceColorSensor, COLOR_SENSOR_DESCR),

Review,LennP,"I would suggest just writing names out fully when they are not too long. Makes it much easier to understand what the function does when quickly reading through it. Same goes for a couple of other cases like using 'desc' for 'description', or 'devinfo' for 'device_info' which you already addressed. Difference in length is not too much but something like device_info or _handle_number_update is much clearer as opposed to devinfo or _handle_upd

Review,LennP,"Why do you use a separate function `create_device_info` if that function is only really used once? Also, I think you can remove sw_version if it will never be known, and if it will change later you can set it to `None` instead of `""unknown""`

Actually I don't think you even need to save the DeviceInfo in hass.data right? If possible I would suggest just moving it to the constructor of `BaseSensor`

Hey @cyberjunky - thanks for reaching out! That's really cool! I was thinking about using a module like that but that also adds some complexity as I like to review all the code in dependent packages.

I have created a PR https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/48042, still some errors to fix, I was using the CryptoXLib code at first but in the end I isolated the Bitvavo API code and created a Bitvavo only library 'bitvavo-aio'.

Well in most cases some value (e.g. 0,00001) is left behind after purchase as Binance will round the amount of coins you purchase.

Issue,Lash-L,"Whoever ends up doing the next review, be it frenck or whoever else (no rush obviously). Should I be adding in Virtual integrations for the actual utility companies that southern company owns/ users log into? They all share an api, but have different customers. Or should I add a virtual integration for the one I have tested ( Georgia Power)? Or is this not a instance of when a virtual integration should be used/ should it be in its own separate PR once this one is merged?

i tried this strategy in the beginning, but because there is a long time between PR reviews and commits to fix the review points, when i need to rebase there are endless conflicts to resolve. maybe im rebasing wrong? is this expected? i dont do it often.",2021-04-29T17:12:58Z,,marengaz,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/45915,False,False

2. `self.hass.data` has type `Any`. Use `typing.cast`. You can define schema for `self.hass.data[DOMAIN][self.entry_id]` using `TypedDict`. Then you can cast only that part: `cast(Data, self.hass.data[DOMAIN][self.entry_id])[""rako_light_map""]`.

Review,milanmeu,"It is recommended to use [key references](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400528-key-referencing) so that we only have to translate common words once in [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/signup/130246255a974bd3b5e8a1.51616605/all/).
Developers docs: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/translations#translation-placeholders

### Common keys
The `common` keys list: [homeassistant/strings.json](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/strings.json)
These have the following format: `[%key:common::JSON-PATH::JSON-PATH::THE-KEY%]`
Example:
`[%key:common::config_flow::data::port%]` will be converted to the value from [homeassistant/strings.json](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/strings.json): `Port`.


### Component keys
It is also possible to make a reference to a key in [homeassistant/components/rako/strings.json](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/45915/files/f516650ab7c1e900cd437b845a2fc04b09d6e217#diff-12b41571ac481723939fddc1f22894804eab5959adcaa7c4f56c5c2432fc8099).
These have the following format: `[%key:component::rako::JSON-PATH::JSON-PATH::key%]`
Example: 
`[%key:component::rako::config::step::user::description%]` will be converted to `If pre-populated, Bridge was auto-discovered!`

### More information
It is possible to combine references with strings. Example:
`[%key:common::config_flow::data::name%] (Optional)` becomes `Name (Optional)`

It is possible to combine references with references. Example:
`[%key:common::config_flow::data::host%]:[%key:common::config_flow::data::port%]` becomes `Host:Port` 

It is not allowed to make a reference to a reference. (https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/46999)
It is not allowed to make a component reference to another integration.

### Suggestion

- `Port` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::data::port%]` (Port)

Choose what fits best or don't use a reference if none fits:
- `Host IP` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::data::host%]` (Host)
- `Host IP` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::data::ip%]` (IP Address)
- `Host IP` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::data::host%] or [%key:common::config_flow::data::ip%]` (Host or IP Address)

This changes ""bridge"" to ""device"". If bridge fits better then no reference can be used.
- `No bridge found on the network` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::abort::no_devices_found%]` (No device found on the network)

Choose what fits best or don't use a reference if none fits:
- `Cannot connect to the Bridge` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::error::cannot_connect%]` (Failed to connect)
- `Cannot connect to the Bridge` -> `[%key:common::config_flow::error::cannot_connect%]` (Failed to connect to the Bridge)",2021-02-25T17:47:29Z,,marengaz,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/45915,True,False

I'm a little confused about what this refers to. The manifest specifies an exact version which seems to be common practice looking at other integrations, and the BLE library itself uses fuzzy version matching (https://github.com/iotmaestro/vevor-heater-ble/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

I see - I read the comment the other way around (that `~=3.2.1` is the desired state). Something something 5AM wakeups. Fixed now, and also the tests. Please take another look.

I don't believe my account would get banned, as I have been testing this with my own doors for about 2 months now and I haven't received any disciplinary action.

Review,Lash-L,"Right now you haven't. But unless if i am misreading something you are logging in 17,280 times at a minimum each day since you log in each time the coordinator updates. and the coordinator is set to update every 5 seconds

If 100 people used this integration that's almost 2 million additional log ins a day. 1000 users, almost 20 million. 

They will probably have to investigate why there is a massive increase in usage of their authentication server and why it is under load, while there has not been a corresponding increase in customers. Then they will either ban accounts or build some functionality to stop you from doing it how you are doing it right now.

That is my opinion at least.

Good to know, I thought it might be the case indeed. I've refactored the code to leverage `async_discovered_service_info()` and use the edilkamin library to only parse the result.

> You might want to look at the other `_ble` integrations for inspiration (though many of them are sensor only, and I'm not sure how hooking up the active command bits would work; cc @bdraco on that...).

I did look a lot of that indeed, but had hard time finding a cloud based integration that was only using bluetooth for the initial device discovery like in my case.
Basically that device is driven from an API on the ""cloud"", but no endpoint would return the device ""ID"", that can only be extracted using the device bluetooth MAC at the moment.
So it might look like a bluetooth integration, but it's not.
In the future I may also reverse their bluetooth protocol and make a fully bluetooth alternative integration, but for now I'm using their cloud integration.

Hi @shisva thanks for sharing.
This integration doesn't actually rely on bluetooth to control the device.
The device is connected to the cloud and you control them by calling a cloud API.
The bluetooth is only used for the initial discovery in order to know the ID of the device you're controlling",2022-11-30T13:49:51Z,,AndreMiras,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/82850,False,False

Issue,frenck,"I've just gave it another go. The good news is: I can login now 👍  The bad news is, there are no updates coming through. 😞 

I have the Aqara M2 hub connected to my Aqara account, with multiple devices. In this case, I tested with a Aqara motion sensor and a door/window sensor. Both devices show up in Home Assistant as expected.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195327/196247885-2af5f60b-8762-48a7-88e9-0698054490e6.png)

Their initial state on startup is correct and matches the device. But after the initial, the state is never updated again. The state of the contact sensor and the motion sensor both show up in the Aqara app (when opening/closing the contact sensor or when motion is detected). But nothing happens in Home Assistant. The state in Home Assistant won't change when opening/closing the contact sensor or when motion is detected.

Ah...
I developed on Fedora 34 which depends (comes with) Python 3.9.
legrand_rflc requires pypi lc7001 1.0.1 which depends on this version (3.9).
That's why it breaks under 3.8.

It turns out that legrand_rflc and pypi lc7001 do work with Python 3.8 (even though the rest of Fedora isn't happy).
I updated the requirements to call for pypi lc7001 new version 1.0.2 (which now calls for Python >= 3.8).
See new commit.

Yes, it confused me too. These are two different, incompatible, ecosystems. They each were derived from different sources (acquisitions).

Both support light switches in their own, mutually incompatible, ecosystem.

A merge is a bad idea. These are completely different things. Also, one (that) is cloud based while the other (this) is Local Push.

In my submitted documentation, I have clearly said what this **is**.
```
The Legrand RF Lighting Control integration allows you to control and monitor the lights connected to your Legrand|On-Q LC7001 Whole House Lighting Controller.
```
There are many things that it **is not**.

Just like any core Home Assistant integration, I think a user should be able to assume that this is not like any other integration or why else would it be here.

Legrand is the make. RFLC is the model. Home+ Control is another Legrand model. Saying that RFLC is not Home+ Control is like saying a Corvette is not a Camaro.
I have no problem saying it but it just seems silly.

I am not confused about different things from another manufacturer.

Such a UI would be really useful and could handle other variations of this concern such as if we wanted to let the user choose between using the native integration for an thermostat (quite a few of these are cloud and polling based) or using the homekit API (which is local and push based, and doesn't require the user to get a developer API key).",2021-11-18T10:49:52Z,,rtyle,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/53430,True,False

Or a single setup function per platform and you just put the entities in separate modules. How can you break up a config flow into multiple modules? It's currently a single class per flow isn't it?

It also breaks some of our developer flows as the developers of the sub integrations might be unrelated, they don't want to be codeowners of each other's sub integration.

The Nest one is kinda ok because the entities are somewhat related and it's somewhat transitionary rather than completely unrelated, but there is a lot of boilerplate here.

So I stand by my opinion here, though I know it's not worth much to you. Right now, this is a boilerplate heavy workaround to use configflows to make up for a UI deficit. I think it's a Ui concern driving a backend decision.

I just have concerns about the details of this implementation approach. The ""nitty gritty"". They come from a place of love and wanting the best outcome for everyone.

One thing I like about your idea is that it could potentially probe a device and pick the right sub integration automatically. E.g. by seeing which ports are open. I don't think that is the case in *this* particular case because Home Control and Legrand RFLC are so different (local vs cloud), you have to make a decision to login or to enter an IP before we can do anything clever?

I think there are potentially lots of small paper cuts with it (exactly because there are (currently) only 2 integrations in this situation) (But there are more, btw - e.g. Honeywell):

* I was initially concerned with boilerplate. I hoped if we had an architecture conversation about your idea someone cleverer than either of us would suggest some way to have HA core load the subintegration directly and avoid nearly all the boilerplate.
* One immediately obvious concrete example of a paper cut is one of your own code cleanups - #49865. It's only a small detail, but RFLC is a local connection class. The other is cloud. You can't have both in a single manifest. If we have a single integration made of subintegrations, `iot_class` cannot be a property of the manifest. I guess this means even in the core team we still have some confusion about what an integration is?
* This idea will dilute/confuse the meanings of the `codeowner`, `requirements` and `quality_scale` keys too.  I don't think @rtyle really wants to end up answering bug reports about `home_plus_control`. And @rtyle thinks this code is platinum grade, where as the existing legrand integration doesn't offer any quality level.

As I said above, in this particular case I don't think we can automatically pick the right integration. The user needs to know whether to login to the cloud system or enter a host and password. It seems like we should be able to guide them to make the right choice from the ""add integration"" UI without invoking a config flow first.",2021-11-18T15:06:28Z,,rtyle,,https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/53430,True,False
Issue,rtyle,"> I don't think @rtyle really wants to end up answering bug reports about `home_plus_control`

Certainly not. I am a HA developer newbie making an honest effort to contribute and play by the rules. That is hard enough but now, it seems, the rules are changing under my feet. All of this is making my head spin.

Legrand is a huge company with **many** brands
https://www.legrand.us/Brands
Many of these brands are based on acquisitions of companies of the same name.
Products and technologies that have grown from these different sources are still supported and growing under the Legrand brands.

Of interest here are Wattstopper, On-Q and Netatmo.

Wattstopper (acquired in the 90s) owns the trademark for the Topdog RF communications layer (not z-wave or zigbee) which is used by RFLC. On-Q (acquired in the 00s) is responsible for the ethernet/IP gateway (lc7001 hub) used by RFLC. Their API allows local access.

Netatmo (acquisition started in 2018) uses the Zigbee protocol and requires a different  Wi-Fi gateway. Their API accesses devices indirectly through the cloud.

Legrand considers the products we are discussing as separate, independent systems at the same smart-lighting level.
RF Lighting Control
https://www.legrand.us/solutions/smart-lighting/radio-frequency-lighting-controls
Smart Lighting with Netatmo 
https://www.legrand.us/solutions/smart-lighting/with-netatmo

Basically, the only thing that these product lines have in common is the Legrand logo on the box.
If/when Legrand swallows up Leviton, that shouldn't imply that the existing/different HA integrations for Leviton need to be swallowed up under a single Legrand integration.

I am frustrated. I don't know what to do. I don't know how this process works, who the players are and what weight their voice carries. I have seen @frenck on HA youtube videos. Does his disapproval sink this ship?

Issue,homeassistant,"Hello @cibernox,

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:

- [`ab3f74e6e96fa46b7a2fadb7d39f67f6f52dc85f`](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;home-assistant&#x2F;core&#x2F;pull&#x2F;72982&#x2F;commits&#x2F;ab3f74e6e96fa46b7a2fadb7d39f67f6f52dc85f) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (miguel_camba@apple.com). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.
- [`f94ed3da51d634e9f091930081a1ef3e2dd239fb`](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;home-assistant&#x2F;core&#x2F;pull&#x2F;72982&#x2F;commits&#x2F;f94ed3da51d634e9f091930081a1ef3e2dd239fb) - This commit has something that looks like an email address (miguel_camba@apple.com). Maybe try linking that to GitHub?.

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward. GitHub provides some great instructions on how to change your authorship information [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).
   * If you only made a single commit you should be able to run
      ```
      git commit --amend --author=""Author Name <email@address.com>""
      ```
      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.
   * Whichever method you choose, I will come by to re-check the pull request once you push the fixes to this branch.

We apologize for this inconvenience, especially since it usually bites new contributors to Home Assistant. We hope you understand the need for us to protect ourselves and the great community we all have built legally.

When attempting to inspect the commits of your pull request for CLA signature status among all authors we encountered commit(s) which were not linked to a GitHub account, thus not allowing us to determine their status(es).

The commits that are missing a linked GitHub account are the following:

Unfortunately, **we are unable to accept this pull request until this situation is corrected.**

Here are your options:

1. If you had an email address set for the commit that simply wasn't linked to your GitHub account you can link that email now and it will retroactively apply to your commits. The simplest way to do this is to click the link to one of the above commits and look for a blue question mark in a blue circle in the top left. Hovering over that bubble will show you what email address you used. Clicking on that button will take you to your email address settings on GitHub. Just add the email address on that page and you're all set. GitHub has more information about this option [in their help center](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/#commits-on-github-arent-linking-to-my-account).

2. If you didn't use an email address at all, it was an invalid email, or it's one you can't link to your GitHub, you will need to change the authorship information of the commit and your global Git settings so this doesn't happen again going forward.

      (substituting Author Name and email@address.com for your actual information) to set the authorship information.
   * If you made more than one commit and the commit with the missing authorship information is not the most recent one you have two options:
       1. You can re-create all commits missing authorship information. This is going to be the easiest solution for developers that aren't extremely confident in their Git and command line skills.
       2. You can use [this script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/) that GitHub provides to rewrite history. **Please note:** this should be used only if you are very confident in your abilities and understand its impacts.

Issue,RockPaperPencil,"I have been running the sbidy/wiz_light integration for a while and thought I would take this PR for a spin.
So I pulled sbidy/core and built myself a Docker image of the current wiz_light branch on top of *armv7-homeassistant-base:2021.01.0* which is now running in my home.

A couple of observations/thoughts:

## Missing label/explanation for host address input
![missing-field-description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21171566/104247388-ff81e680-5467-11eb-8ba0-e5a746163608.png)

### Input validation error message 
If triggering an input validation error with a non-supported address, the *Name* field will reset.
This leads to users not just having to input the host address one more time, but their desired name as well.
![error-handling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21171566/104247595-62737d80-5468-11eb-8eb5-d534e867cbe4.png)
Also, typo with the **enterd** IP.

### Limited to adding lights by IP through GUI
My router runs OpenWRT and will happily register and resolve DHCP client hostnames. This means that I don't have to worry about static DHCP address entries, and have defined my lights in the following manner from previously:
```yaml
light:
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: spisebord
    host: wiz_7395e0
```
Should it work the same way through the GUI as through configuration.yaml?

The architecture decision is from 2020, as seen here: https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0010-integration-configuration.md#decision

I've also stumble upon this a couple times in the past when submitting code, it's also documented here: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration_yaml_index

From a user perspective and in alignment to the ADR I'd say that it's much easier for a user to set up an IP/Host directly in the UI than manually going in the configuration YAML.

> Note: The auto discovery of the bulbs are added, but this will not work in a container-ed environment because the bulb discovery will happen via UDP broadcast, which is not that easy to implement in a standard docker environment (network_mode: host etc.).

I'm not sure what discovery type wiz uses, but you are free to provide the user with default data in the config flow that you can for example provide via a multicast request (it works with network_mode: host). We are also using this for our GatewayScanner in the KNX integration.

If wiz supports any of the HA discovery modes you can implement them directly in the config flow for an even better user experience: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/network_discovery/.

> No changes to (newer) implementation guides: Sorry, but I don't want to change my code/PR every time the HASS dev guide was updated. 

Most of the review comments you received where about things that are already documented in the HA dev guide for a long time (i.e. the YAML config deprecation). Technology evolves, and this in turn means the dev guides might get adjusted. The work is not done when new integrations are merged, there is maintenance and feature additions as well. 

> I'm waiting since the beginning of this year for a fundamental feedback to the integration. Now I wait for a workflow approval to test the code. Obviously there are multiple HASS users out there which are waiting for this interaction.

There are a lot of PRs open as you can see, it takes time. Especially for bigger ones.

> And yes the integration is not 100% aligned with the (moving) development requirements of HASS BUT most of the existing and new ones are also not that ""good"". Yes there are ""broad exceptions"" ... 

Well I can tell you from past experience that it will not get merged until it meets those requirements and that is good. After all, those requirements are there for a very good reason.

I personally can't help you with that problem as I don't own a wiz bulb and thus can't properly test and analyse it, but there are maybe some people in the HA discord that can help you with your problem.

I have asked the discord (multiple times) for a hint or possible root cause of this issue. With no luck.
But 😃 .... I saw you are from Germany too. So I received multiple testing bulbs from the vendor ""WiZ"". If you are interested in helping me with this issue/integration, I can send you one or two of these bulbs!! Please send me a PM to hello(at)stephan-traub.de with your contact details.

For the other comments, I'll review these and made appropriate changes to the code.
Regarding the ""HASS discovery mode"": Dose HASS support discovery via UDP boardcast? I possibly missed this in the documentation?!

It does not natively, but you can still build around it in a config flow, that's not a big deal.

I wrote you on discord and I also tested this with my own bulb and created a PR for this PR:  https://github.com/sbidy/core/pull/2

This will not be possible in the initial release. To keep the PR as small as possible only 1 platform (the lock itself) is added. Once this gets merged we can continue to add functionality such as changing the lock's settings.

The [Loqed web API](https://support.loqed.com/en/articles/6127911-loqed-web-api-integration) does not support **changing** the ""open house mode"", nor does it trigger a webhook call when it is enabled/disabled in the Loqed app.

It is only possible to **see** the current status of open house mode, when manually requesting the status using the web API (**not** when using the local bridge API): `guest_access_mode` has value 0 or 1.

Review,joostlek,"This is because you are referencing the climate entity in the coordinator (and the climate entity requires the coordinator). If I understand correctly you are doing this because the coordinator can discover new devices and add them on the go.

Other integrations solve this by doing stuff with listeners, for example the hue integration:
